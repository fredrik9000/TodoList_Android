# Todo List

This todo list app is written in Kotlin and with a modern MVVM architecture. The app uses the repository pattern and several Android architecture components and Jetpack libraries, such as:

- Navigation component
- ViewModel
- Room
- LiveData
- Data Binding and View Binding
- ConstraintLayout

#### The app has the following features:

- Add and edit tasks
- Search for tasks
- Set tasks to completed, and back to uncompleted
- Add date and time notifications to tasks
- Set geofences and add location based notifications to tasks
- Voice input option for entering the tasks title and description
- Set a priority level for each task (low, medium, high)
- Remove tasks and/or notifications with undo
- UI for both dark mode and light mode, which can be toggled from within the app

In order to use geofencing you'll need to create your own Google Maps API key.

I have also made a simpler version for iOS: [iOS Todo List](https://github.com/fredrik9000/TodoList_iOS)
